Allows you to show your NaNoWriMo Stats in posts, pages and sidebar widgets.

== Description ==

Allows you to show your NaNoWriMo Stats in posts, pages and sidebar widgets. Also, NaNoWriMo widgets are available.

The NaNo Stats plugin comes with clear explanation and documentation.

This is an unofficial plugin, not made by the Office of Letters and Light.

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder `nano-stats` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is NaNoWriMo? =
NaNoWriMo is short for National Novel Writing Month. It is a worldwide contest for (hobby)writers to write 50,000 words in one month, November. For more information, please visit http://nanowrimo.org.

= My charts and widgets are loading slowly. What can be done about this? =
I'm afraid this is not an issue of the plugin but of http://nanowrimo.org. During November, this site gets a huge load of data traffic, which causes it to shutdown quiet often during this month. There is nothing that can be done about this, except improving the NaNoWriMo servers.

= Can I use the plugin for Camp NaNoWriMo as well? =
Unfortunately, [Camp NaNoWriMo](http://www.campnanowrimo.org) does _not_ provide statistics info. So no, you cannot use this plugin with Camp NaNoWriMo - hopefully in the future!

== Screenshots ==

1. With an easy shortcode, you can add this awesome stats chart to your site! Colors, size and title are customizable.
2. The settings page is clear and simple.
